# movie-recommendation-system
## ðŸ“¢ Note  

This project is created as a learning-based implementation of a movie recommendation system.  
It is designed to demonstrate how recommendation engines work using machine learning techniques like similarity scores and content-based filtering.  
The goal is not just to recommend movies but also to provide a simple, beginner-friendly example that can be extended into real-world applications.  
Anyone interested in recommendation systems, data science, or machine learning can use this project as a starting point and build upon it with new features like collaborative filtering, hybrid models, or even deployment as a web app.
